Use node 'Dummy Mouse Button Clicked', check off 'Double Click'.

Assume that the current mouse is on the something to be dragged. Trigger event 'Drag Something', then you will see that it will drag to the right.

This plugin provide two option to finish that job, using absolute coordinate or viewport coordinate.





###  Simulate key input

There are two ways to achieve this. They are equivalent.

It is worth noting that 'Repeat' should not be checked when pressed key. Do not check up 'Repeat' unless you need to repeatedly trigger the pressed event.
